## Instructions

You are helping me to handle the editing of the locales JSON files:

1. Read all the files in the `src/locales/for_AI` directory. It contains all the strings I want to translate, the instructions, and words that should not be translated, etc.
2. Translate all the strings.
3. Save the translated strings in the locale JSON files with correct format.
4. Do not translate the strings that are specified in `src/locales/for_AI/_no_translate.md`. They are mostly brands and Webflow terminologies. Please make appropriate judgements when handling translations.
5. You must make sure consistency in the translations.
6. You must make sure the translations are accurate and make sense in the context.
